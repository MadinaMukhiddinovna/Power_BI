1. What is Power BI, and what are its three main components?
Power BI is a powerful Business Intelligence tool developed by Microsoft. It allows users to collect data from multiple sources, transform and model it, create interactive visualizations, and share insights within an organization. It helps users make better business decisions by presenting data in a meaningful and accessible way.
       The three main components of Power BI are:
•	Power BI Desktop: A free desktop application for data modeling and report creation. This is where analysts and developers design dashboards, clean data, and create visuals.
•	Power BI Service: A cloud-based platform for publishing, sharing, and collaborating on reports online. It supports scheduled refresh, user access control, and app workspaces.
•	Power BI Mobile: A mobile application that allows users to access dashboards and reports on their phones or tablets. It’s useful for business leaders who need access to data on the go.
Example: A sales manager creates a report using Power BI Desktop, publishes it to Power BI Service for the marketing team, and reviews sales KPIs while traveling using Power BI Mobile.

2. Name two business use cases for Power BI dashboards.
1.	Sales Dashboard: A company can track monthly revenue by product, region, or salesperson, compare targets versus actuals, and visualize trends over time.
2.	Financial Dashboard: Finance teams can monitor expenses, profit margins, cash flow, and budget allocations in real-time.
Example: An e-commerce company uses a Power BI dashboard to monitor real-time inventory levels and quickly identify when stock needs replenishing.

2.	Click on “Download” → then “Power BI Desktop.”
3.	Choose the version for your Windows system (typically 64-bit).
4.	Alternatively, open Microsoft Store and search for “Power BI Desktop.”
5.	Click "Install" and follow the setup instructions.
After installation, you can launch Power BI Desktop from your Start menu. It’s completely free and updates regularly.

4. What is the difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service?
Feature	Power BI Desktop	Power BI Service
     Type    	Desktop application	Web-based (cloud platform)
Purpose	Data modeling and report creation	Sharing, viewing, and collaboration
Data Refresh	Manual	Automatic (scheduled)
Sharing Capability	Not supported	Fully supported (with Pro license)
Collaboration	Local use only	Multi-user collaboration and app workspaces
Example: A data analyst creates a sales report in Power BI Desktop, and the team leader accesses it online via Power BI Service and shares it with stakeholders.
________________________________________
5. What file extension does a Power BI project use?
Power BI saves its projects using the .pbix file extension. This file contains all the data, visuals, queries, and model created in Power BI Desktop.
Example: When you create a sales report in Power BI Desktop and save it, the file will be named something like SalesDashboard.pbix.

6. Explain the role of Power Query in Power BI.
Power Query is the tool used for data preparation in Power BI. It allows users to connect to various data sources (like Excel, SQL Server, or web data), and clean, transform, and load that data into the report model.
With Power Query, you can:
•	Remove unnecessary columns
•	Filter rows
•	Split columns
•	Replace values
•	Merge data from multiple tables
Example: You import sales data that has extra rows and inconsistent date formats. With Power Query, you can clean this data before creating visuals.

7. Why would a business prefer Power BI over Excel for reporting?
•	Power BI handles large datasets more efficiently than Excel.
•	It supports real-time data refresh and scheduled updates.
•	Offers better data visualizations like slicers, maps, and custom visuals.
•	Reports can be shared and accessed online from anywhere.
•	Supports Row-Level Security and data governance features.
Example: A company dealing with millions of sales records finds Excel slow and prone to crashing, but Power BI loads and filters the same data instantly.

8. Describe one limitation of the free version of Power BI.
The free version of Power BI does not support secure sharing within an organization. Users can only view their reports locally or publish them publicly to the web. For private, professional sharing and collaboration, a Power BI Pro license is required.
Example: An HR manager using the free version can create dashboards but cannot share sensitive employee data securely with the CEO without a Pro account.
________________________________________
9. What is a "published report" in Power BI Service?
A published report is a Power BI report created in Power BI Desktop and uploaded to the Power BI Service. Once published, it becomes accessible online, can be embedded in dashboards, refreshed automatically, and shared with others.
Example: A marketing dashboard showing campaign performance is published to the Power BI Service so department heads can track key metrics in real-time.

10. How does Power BI Mobile enhance accessibility?
Power BI Mobile provides real-time access to reports and dashboards from smartphones and tablets. Users can view KPIs, apply filters, receive alerts, and interact with visuals while away from their desk.
Example: A regional manager uses Power BI Mobile to monitor sales targets while visiting stores across different cities.

11. Compare Power BI with Tableau—pros and cons.
Feature	Power BI	Tableau
Price	More affordable, includes a free version	More expensive, especially for enterprise use
Integration	Best for Microsoft ecosystem (Excel, Azure)	Great for various sources (Salesforce, SQL)
Learning Curve	Easier for beginners and Excel users	Steeper learning curve
Visualization	Strong visuals, less flexible than Tableau	Very powerful and highly customizable
Community	Growing user base and Microsoft support	Mature and large community support
Power BI is ideal for companies using Microsoft products, while Tableau is preferred by teams needing advanced visual customization.

12. Explain how Power BI integrates with Azure services.
Power BI is designed to work seamlessly with Azure tools.
•	Connects directly to Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse, Azure Data Lake, etc.
•	Uses Azure Active Directory for secure user authentication and group permissions.
•	Can connect with Azure Data Factory to automate ETL processes and pipeline refreshes.
•	Supports Azure Blob Storage for data storage.
Example: A company uses Azure Synapse to store processed data and Power BI to visualize it in real-time dashboards.

13. What are "gateways" in Power BI, and when are they needed?
A Power BI Gateway is software that connects on-premises data (such as SQL Server, Excel, or Oracle stored on local servers) with the Power BI cloud. It allows scheduled or live data refreshes from your private network into your Power BI dashboards.
Gateways are needed when data is stored locally and not in the cloud.
Example: A finance team keeps their budget data on a local SQL Server, but the CFO wants to view updated reports in Power BI Service. A gateway keeps the cloud report synced with on-premises data.

14. How would you convince a company to adopt Power BI? (ROI argument)
Power BI provides a high return on investment by:
•	Reducing time spent on manual reporting
•	Providing real-time insights for faster decision-making
•	Lowering IT costs through self-service analytics
•	Improving data visibility and accuracy across departments
•	Integrating easily with tools already used (Excel, SQL, Azure)
Example: A retail company reduced report preparation time from 5 hours to 10 minutes weekly after switching to Power BI, allowing employees to focus on analysis and strategy instead of data entry.

15. What security features does Power BI offer for sensitive data?
•	Row-Level Security (RLS): Controls which data users can view based on their roles.
•	Azure Active Directory integration: Manages authentication and access rights.
•	Data encryption: Protects data at rest and during transmission.
•	Compliance certifications: Meets industry standards such as GDPR, ISO 27001, HIPAA.
•	Sensitivity labels: Help classify and protect confidential data.   
•	Example: A healthcare organization uses RLS so that each doctor only sees patient records for their assigned patients, ensuring confidentiality.
